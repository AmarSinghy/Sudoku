# Sudoku Solver using Backtracking Algorithm and OpenCV

## Overview

This project implements a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm combined with computer vision techniques to preprocess and extract the Sudoku grid from images. By leveraging OpenCV for image processing, the solver can automatically recognize and solve Sudoku puzzles from images efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated Sudoku Extraction**: Utilizes OpenCV to detect and extract the Sudoku grid from images.
- **Efficient Backtracking Algorithm**: Implements the backtracking algorithm to solve the extracted Sudoku puzzles efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input Sudoku images and receive solved puzzles.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9
- OpenCV 
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git
    cd sudoku-solver
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Solver**:
    ```sh
    python sudoku_solver.py --image path_to_sudoku_image
    ```

2. **Input Image**:
    - Provide the path to the Sudoku image that you want to solve.
    - The program will preprocess the image, extract the Sudoku grid, and solve the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.

## How It Works

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
    - The input image is processed using OpenCV techniques such as thresholding and contour detection to locate and extract the Sudoku grid.
    - The extracted grid is then warped to a top-down view for better accuracy.

2. **Digit Recognition**:
    - Each cell of the Sudoku grid is analyzed to recognize digits using image processing techniques.
    - The recognized digits form the initial state of the Sudoku puzzle.

3. **Backtracking Algorithm**:
    - The backtracking algorithm is applied to the initial state to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
    - The algorithm recursively tries different numbers in empty cells until the puzzle is solved.

## Example

Here's a sample input image and the corresponding solved Sudoku puzzle:

**Input Image**:
![Input Sudoku](path_to_input_image)

**Solved Puzzle**:
![Solved Sudoku](path_to_solved_image)
